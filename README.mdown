YUI App Theme
=============

A generic, skinnable layout for web applications built using [YUI Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/). It's particularly well suited for admin areas. You'll find most of the standard UI elements are styled and ready for you to use: blocks, tabbed modules, tables, lists, one and two column forms, etc. Just [explore the demo](http://clickontyler.com/yui-app-theme/) to see what's available. Pay particular attention to the theme and layout panels on the side. They'll let you preview alternate layouts and color schemes with one click.

This project is based on the great idea and design work done by the [web-app-theme](http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme/tree/master) project on GitHub. We loved the concept and simplicity of their web app template but needed it to be built with [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). So we decided to re-implement it ourselves.

The result is a clean, semantically structured layout built using [YUI Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/). We hope you find it useful.

Here's an [introductory blog post](http://clickontyler.com/blog/2009/03/yui-app-theme/) about the project.

And a [live demo](http://clickontyler.com/yui-app-theme/).

FEATURES
--------

 * Built on YUI Grids for easy customization and browser compatibility.
 * Lightweight CSS ~10KB

HOW TO USE
--------
Always include the YUI grids stylesheet. For example, <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.7.0/build/reset-fonts-grids/reset-fonts-grids.css" type="text/css">
Only apply the #hd, #bd and #ft ids to standalone divs.
Never add padding or margin properties to any of the pre-defined YUI classes, including yui-b, yui-g and yui-u.
Use the [YUI Grids Builder](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/) wizard to construct an initial template of your page.  View the yuiapp index.html source to understand how markup should be constructed in the context of YUI Grids.
Always define padding and margins in units of em, and font-sizes in %.  Use an "Em Calculator" such as [this one](http://riddle.pl/emcalc/) to help with this.

INSTALL
-------

To use, customize the HTML and CSS to suit your needs. You can safely remove the &lt;script&gt; references, as they're only used in the demo.
